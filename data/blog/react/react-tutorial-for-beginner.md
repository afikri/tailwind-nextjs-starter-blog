summary: 'React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of the application. The React tutorial covers the basics of creating components, rendering them to the DOM, and handling events and updates. It also covers more advanced topics like hooks, context, and performance optimization. Overall, the tutorial is designed to help developers learn how to build efficient and scalable web applications with React'

## ü§ù Introduction to React

**Overview of React and its features** <br/>
React is javascript libraries which used to create user interfaces.
It was developed and is maintained by Facebook. React's main feature is the ability to build reusable components, which can be combined to create complex user interfaces. React uses a virtual DOM, which improves performance by reducing the amount of changes that need to be made to the actual DOM. Additionally, React also has a feature called **jsx** which allows you to write HTML-like elements in your JavaScript code, making it easier to understand and write. React also supports server-side rendering, which allows you to pre-render pages on the server before they are sent to the client, improving the initial load time.

**Setting up a development environment**<br/>
To set up a development environment for React, a _Node.js_ and _npm_ (Node Package Manager) are needed to be installed on the computer.
The steps to do it

1. Install _Node.js_ from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Verify the installation by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in the command line to check the **version**.

Once _Node.js_ and _npm_ are installed, follow these steps to set up a new _React_ project:

1. Create a new folder for your project and navigate to it in the command line.
2. Run the command `npx create-react-app my-app` to create a new React project. Replace **my-app** with the name of the project.
3. Navigate to the project folder by running `cd my-app`.
4. Start the development server by running `npm start` or `yarn start`
5. Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:3000/` to see the app.

Now, it is time to start building the React app in the **src** folder of the project. To see the changes in the browser, be sure to save the files and then refresh the browser <br/>
Almost forgot to mention that there is a build tool that is similar to Create React App (CRA) called **Vite** but with a focus on faster development and a more lightweight setup. It can be used to create a new React project just like CRA.
