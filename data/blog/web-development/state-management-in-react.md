🔥 **Understand Redux: A Simplified Journey into State Management** 🔥

In this article, we are going to demystify state management in React! 🚀 It is ok whether you're a seasoned developer or just dipping your toes into the Redux waters, this repository is the very basic to understand _Redux_.

📘 **So,...What's Inside?**

Inside the repository, you'll find two branches: `master` and `refactoring`, actually, where the two are identically the same but written in refactored way to give a unique perspective on Redux, where I hope that will give step by step approach of different stages of the learning experience.

🌟 **The Master Branch: Unveiling the Essentials**

The `master` branch is to understand the fundamental concepts of Redux. Here, we've distilled Redux to its simplest form, making it an ideal starting point for beginners. 🎉

So, what exactly does Redux entail?

1. **Global Store**: It acts like a store, yes, it is like a **real world store** where all our application's data stays, but they are accessible from every our React components.

2. **Actions**: Think of actions like you are messenger carrying tidbits of information, dispatched with a single purpose: to trigger changes in your application's state.

3. **Reducers**: They are the masterminds behind state updates, meticulously crafting a new reality based on the actions they receives.

📦 **Getting Started**

To start to dive into the Redux, what we need to do first it to install it using npm or yarn, in my case i am still using npm! 🎒

```bash
npm install react-redux redux --save
```

Here, we start to understand Redux from bottom up.
